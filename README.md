## INTRODUCTION

The Simple Mail Test module allows you to send a single email to a configurable
email address using the site's default mailsystem.

The primary use case for this module is to check where default emails are sent.


## REQUIREMENTS

Ensure your mail system, local environment or server is configured to send mail.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.

## CONFIGURATION
Alter the default testing address at
`/admin/config/system/settings/simple-mail-test`

Submitting the forms sets the default email address, and triggers an email to be
sent.
